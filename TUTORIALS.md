# What is Buying Project

Buying a large-ticket product or service is like working on a project, you need to spend time research prices and negotiate deals with sellers.  Buying Project is the project management tool developed by [SaveNowClub](https://savenowclub.com) for large-ticket product or service buyers to create a public page to manage price research activities and/or sell your completed deal information to people who are in need of it.

Here is an [example buying project](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago) that does price research on a used SUV near Chicago area.

Our Buying Project supports these types of buying targets:

* Vehicle (new or old)
* Piano (new or old)
* Insurance (any type of insurance)
* Property Tax Protesting Service
* Other

It's easy to create a Buying Project, simply fill out [this form](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project), describe your goal (price research or share/sell deal information) in Description field.  After the project is created and public, share the project link with your friends or on public forums so you will get help needed or people can find price records they need.

## Comment to Buying Project

Buying Projects are like questions asked by buyers that solicit answers from other people who may have answers, in many cases, these questions lack certain information for other people to better understand the needs in order to better answer it, when this happens, comment feature can be used to ask clarifying questions to project owners or answering these questions.  Once a comment is submitted, email notices will be sent to project owner and comment creator.

See screen shot below for an example of comment section of an existing Buying Project.

## Buying Group

Buying Group is a type of Buying Project that allows buyers to join as members and collectively pursue a deal for a common product.

To create a Buying Group, simply check `Make this a Buying Group` checkbox when you create a Buying Project

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-group-creation.png" title="buying group creation form" style="max-width:100%">

### Benefits of Buying Group

Creating your buying project as a buying group on SaveNowClub platform brings you a number of benefits.  If you are organizing or about to join a Buying Group, consider the following advantage of SaveNowClub’s Buying Group vs. Google Form vs. WeChat Groups vs. Facebook Groups

**Member Benefits**: while group discount a buy group may get from dealer is relatively small (may be a few hundred dollars per vehicle), joining a buy group brings the benefit of enjoying collective efforts on negotiating towards same model of vehicle which covers a wider range of dealerships in a wider range of geographical areas.

#### Group Negotiation

This feature enables every member of a buying group to collaborate on negotiating deals with dealers using emails, see a [demo](#collaborative-group-negotiation-demo) here.  The [proxy mailbox](#step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email) used by group negotiation are provided by SaveNowClub and are dedicated for the purpose of deal negotiation, can be [turned on or off](#step-42-one-click-turn-on-off-agent) at any time.  

**Membership Capabilities**

* Membership information of a Buying Group can be modified or deleted, while it’s not possible to do it on Google Form
* Group Members' email addresses will be verified while Google Sheet does not verify email addresses of sign up members
* Multiple types of members are allowed to join the group: Buyer, Dealer or Broker, this makes it easier to reach a deal
* Advantage over Facebook Groups: Members may remain anonymous to the public and to each other group members, while you have to show your real name in Facebook Groups

**Marketing Capabilities**

* Buying Group page is public and easy to attract new members while keeping membership information private, but Google Form address is usually private and cannot generate organic traffic.
* Advantage over WeChat Groups: the fact that SaveNowClub buying group has a public page and allows dealers / brokers to join makes it easier to attract sellers to make offer to the group and to reach a deal, while WeChat Groups are private and lack a public page to attract sellers to make an offer.

**Communication Capabilities**

* Every group member will get notified upon new public or private updates with material and valuable information.
* Comments may be added under membership profile or project update for clarification purposes.
* Buying Group page mixes public and private project notes, private ones are visible to group members only
* Buying Group page mixes public and private updates, private ones are visible to group members only


# What is Price Record

After a buying project is created, one or multiple price/deal data points may be added to it, these price/deal data points are called **Price Records**, these are what people look for when they research prices on their buying targets.  Buytition supports two types of price records: price offer and price paid.

Here is an [example price record](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago#t86) of a price offer for a used SUV near Chicago area.

Each price record is made up of 3 parts: public information, private information and dedicated mailbox

* **public information**: accessible by general public, includes product/service name, price, area/zip code, and public description
* **private information**: accessible by owner and buyers of price record only, includes
    * available to both owner and buyers of price record: dealer information, deal making descriptions
    * available to only owner: source URL, vehicle VIN

## Dedicated Mailbox

* **dedicated mailbox**: optionally attached to a price record, accessible by owner of price record or group members of a buying group only, the mailbox comes with these handy benefits
    * an email address (e.g. `bot2111@buytition.com`) dedicated to this price record, your personal email sits behind this email address so your privacy is protected.
    * all inbound/outbound email messages regarding a price record are organized in one place
    * [collaborative communication to seller](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) and [peer-to-peer communication](#step-31-peer-to-peer-communication)
    * [one-click mute incoming emails](#step-42-one-click-turn-on-off-agent)
    * [reply directly](#step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email) from your personal email account
    * each inbound/outbound message is tagged with price record link so you can easily trace it back to its original intent.

## For Sellers: Listing Criteria

All added price records are reviewed by SaveNowClub Team, after review, price records that satisfy the following conditions are placed on sale:

1. **trustworthy**: the accuracy of price record is verified by SaveNowClub using either or both of these two methods:
    * **source verified**: the price record was published at least once on the Internet before being listed for sale, therefore this price record has at least one third-party source.
    * **document verified**: the transaction document that verifies the price record is available.
2. **valuable**: it includes valuable information such as dealer name and/or detailed negotiation tips

## For Sellers: Ownership of Price Record

## For Sellers: Sale Proceeds

Whenever someone purchases a record, price record owner receives 70% of sale price as sale proceeds, the remaining 30% covers SaveNowClub platform service fee and credit card transaction fees, e.g. for price records listed at $5 USD, owner receives $3.5 USD after any sale completed on the price record.  Owner will receive funds once the accumulated seller balance reaches $10 USD via PayPal.

## For Sellers: Claim a Price Record

# Demo

Below you can find a simple tutorial of how to use Email Buyer Agent for your car buying.

## Step 1: Create a Buying Project

If you don't have an account yet, click [create an account](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) using a personal email address (in this tutorial I use `buytition.car@gmail.com`) and use it to [sign in](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/signin) to SaveNowClub.  If you have not verified your personal email yet, then click `Reset Password` button to verify it.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/sign-in-to-buytition.png" title="sign in to buytition" style="max-width:100%">

Open [Start Project](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) page to create a buying project for free and use it as a **car buying worksheet** to track all target vehicles and negotiations around them.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buying-project.png" title="create buying project" style="max-width:100%">

After you submit the above simple form, the project is created like this or can be viewed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget)

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-created.png" title="buying project created" style="max-width:100%">

## Step 2: Add Email Buyer Agent to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can start adding buyer agent to it

### Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/grab-vehicle-url.png" title="grab vehicle URL" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 2.2: Create Email Buyer Agent

After target vehicle page is available, go back to the [buying project](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget) you just created in [previous step](#step-1-create-a-buying-project), scroll to the bottom, click **Add Buyer Agent** link

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-bottom.png" title="buying project bottom" style="max-width:100%">

Fill out **Create Buyer Agent** form with vehicle name, vehicle URL and other vehicle details info found in [previous step](#step-21-find-your-target-vehicle-online), and click `Submit` button

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buyer-agent-top.png" title="create Email Buyer Agent" style="max-width:100%">
<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buyer-agent.png" title="create Email Buyer Agent" style="max-width:100%">

Now a Email Buyer Agent proxy email (`bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case) is created, all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buyer-agent-created.png" title="Buyer Agent created notice" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 2.3: Car Buying Worksheet

The created buyer agent will show up in the Buying Project page as shown below or can be accessed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#b42).  Buyer may add any number of such Buyer Agents and modify them to keep track all target vehicle and negotiation at one place so the buying project becomes buyer's buying worksheet.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login-proxy-email.png" title="Buyer Agent proxy email tooltip" style="max-width:100%">

## Step 3: How to use Proxy Email

After Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, a Proxy Email address is created.  The EBA proxy email is a powerful tool that enables easy three-way communication between project author, EBA author, and seller i.e. anybody else.

### Step 3.1: Peer-to-Peer Communication

Let's say I am helping Project Author on this buying project, and I created this EBA, very likely Project Author and I need to communicate with each other, for that purpose, I simply write an email to EBA proxy email address, in this demo `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, and send it, and EBA will forward that email to project author.  And vice versa, if project author does the same, I will receive that email from him/her.

The difference between this type of communication vs [seller communication](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) is that for seller communication, you always need to reply an incoming email, but for peer-to-peer communication, you start from scratch and send it.

### Step 3.2: Collaboratively Communicate with Seller

A while after an EBA is created, EBA author will start receiving emails from seller,  which will be copied to project author as well if he/she was not EBA author.

In this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png" title="inbound email top" style="max-width:100%">

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price.  If project author is a different person, he/she may reply to same email as well and I will be copied with that reply so I am notified that project author has replied.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG" title="reply dealer email" style="max-width:369px;" <!--365,649-->>

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-03.png" title="inbound email" style="max-width:100%">

### Collaborative Group Negotiation Demo

Take for example the [dedicated mailbox](#dedicated-mailbox) `bot2270@buytition.com` that comes with [this price offer](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group#t245) for [Audi Q7 buying group](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group):

* all of its inbound or outbound email messages are visible (via [the link](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/messages?srch_term=BUYER_AGENT_ID:2270) next to the mailbox after login) to all participating buyers including price record owner, project owner and group members (if project is a buying group), in addition, participating buyers are allowed to reply to inbound emails on our website by clicking the bright orange icon on upper right corner of message detail page ([this](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/view_msg?id=70321) for example, member login required).
* its mailbox `bot2270@buytition.com` was created with the price record of 2021 Audi Q7 in MD, but it can also be used to negotiate deal with multiple dealers, simply use that address to start negotiation with any Audi dealers and email messages will be viewable and reply-able on this website by all group members.

## Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent

For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.

### Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login.png" title="email buyer agent after login" style="max-width:100%">

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/vehicle-email-list.png" title="Buyer Worksheet before edit" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 4.2 One Click Turn On / Off Agent

Turn on or off buyer agent with one click, one click to unsubscribe from all messages from sender without worrying about filling out complex form to unsubscribe

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-turned-off.png" title="buyer agent turned off" style="max-width:100%">

or turn on
