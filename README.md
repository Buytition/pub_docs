# About Us

[SaveNowClub](https://savenowclub.com) was originally created to become a platform for price-sensitive buyers to do price research on vaguely priced products or services, such as cars, pianos, local services or even houses and lands.  The idea was to create a platform that allows buyers to create and manage buying petitions and sellers to bid for these petitions and ultimately connect buyers and sellers through buyer-acknowledged best deals.

As you can see, SaveNowClub was originally created as a platform to serve and help **buyers**.

The website savenowclub.com was officially launched in 2020, it was result of multiple pivots and product launches we did in previous years, we never changed our mission which is to create tools to help buyers to more easily get good deals for less-transparently priced items.  Below are a few software tools offered by SaveNowClub.com:
