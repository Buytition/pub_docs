# What is Buytition

**Buytition** stands for **Buy + Petition**, it was inspired by *We The People* petition platform on White House website and was originally created to become a platform for price-sensitive buyers to do price research on vaguely priced products or services, such as cars, pianos, local services or even houses and lands.  The idea was to create a platform that allows buyers to create and manage buying petitions and sellers to bid for these petitions and ultimately connect buyers and sellers through buyer-acknowledged best deals.

As you can see, Buytition was originally created as a platform to serve and help **buyers**.

The idea started around late 2014, we did go a long way and our website buytition.com experienced multiple pivots and launches since then, but we never changed our mission which is to create tools to help buyers to more easily get good deals for less-transparently priced items.  Below are a few softwares we created:
* [buying project](https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/blob/master/TUTORIALS-HOWTO-VBA.adoc#what-is-buying-project)
