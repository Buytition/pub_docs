This is a simple tutorial of how to use Vehicle Buyer Agent for your car buying.

# Step 1: Create a Buying Project

Open https://buytition.com/projects/show-form/start-project[Start Project] page to create a buying project for free and use it as a **car buying worksheet** to track all target vehicles and negotiations around them.

# Step 2: Add Buyer Agent to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can start adding buyer agent to it

## Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

## Step 2.2: Create Buyer Agent

Then a Vehicle Buyer Agent proxy email, something like `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, is created, now all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

As soon as you create vehicle buyer agent for your target vehicle, it is added to your buyer worksheet list under your Buytition account

## Edit Target Vehicle in Buyer Worksheet

After you login to your Buyer Worksheet, the Volvo XC60 I just added is shown as `My Dream Vehicle` at top, its link matches the URL I entered earlier, now I click `Edit` button to edit it.

I edit the listing to make it more informative to me, after I finish, I click `Save` button

# Step 3: Communicate with Dealer via Proxy Email

In a while, you will receive email from dealer, in this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Vehicle Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Vehicle Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

## Organize Emails around Target Vehicle

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 12 emails see below

Clicking on email icon will show you all 12 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.
