Then a Vehicle Buyer Agent proxy email, something like `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, is created, now all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

# Step 3/3: Communicate with Dealer via Buyer Agent

In a while, you will receive email from dealer, in this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Vehicle Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Vehicle Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.
