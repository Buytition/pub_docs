# What is Email Buyer Agent

Email Buyer Agent is a car buying tool developed by https://buytition.com[Buytition] for anybody who use email to negotiate car deals with dealers.  To use it, simply start a https://buytition.com/projects/show-form/start-project[Buying Project] for free, then start adding links of your dream cars to it so the project becomes your **Car Buying Worksheet**, and each added car link becomes **Email Buyer Agent** dedicated to track and manage all emails between you and dealer regarding that particular car, and you can mute/unmute each Email Buyer Agent with one-click and enjoy other powerful benefits listed below.

## <<step-2-3-car-buying-worksheet, Car Buying Worksheet>>

Once your buying project is created, it becomes the place where you can track and manage all your research findings for current car buying project.  You may add any number of links of target vehicles to the project, for each of target vehicle link, you may add detail information such as vehicle information, dealer information and price information and update these information at any time.  At the same time, each added vehicle link becomes dedicated Email Buyer Agent (EBA) for that vehicle which gives you even more control on email communications with sellers regarding that vehicle.

## Collaborative Negotiation

This is a powerful feature offered by <<what-is-email-buyer-agent, Email Buyer Agent (EBA)>> to empower not only buyer him/herself, but also buyer's one or multiple friends to collaborate with buyer to email negotiate a deal with seller.

After a Buying Project is created by a buyer, the buyer him/herself and other people may contribute by adding EBA to it.  For any EBA created by anybody, its details, including all email messages of EBA, will be accessible by not only who created it but also the project owner.  All seller emails sent to EBA proxy email address will be forwarded to both the project owner and the EBA owner.

And because one buying project may have unlimited number of EBA added to it, multiple friends of buyer may add multiple EBA to it respectively, while each EBA can be only accessed by the EBA owner and the buyer i.e. project author, all the created EBA can be accessed by project author so he/she can oversee and participate into negotiation processes of all EBA added to the project.

## <<step-4-2-one-click-turn-on-off-agent, One Click Mute Seller Emails>>

Once an Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, you can mute (or unsubscribe from) all emails sent to the EBA's proxy email address with one click, without need to fill out any unsubscribe form at all.  You may unmute all seller emails at any time later, also with one click.

## <<step-2-2-create-email-buyer-agent, Simple to Create>>

to create an Email Buyer Agent only requires your full name, email address and target vehicle link, price quote, and area information. We respect your privacy and only ask for information absolutely required to do our job, nothing more.

## <<step-4-1-check-buyer-agent-emails, Email Management for Buyer>>

For any created Email Buyer Agent (EBA) that has received emails from buyer or seller, EBA's creator or the creator of EBA's parent buying project are both allowed to check all email communications for that EBA.

After an Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, even though agent's proxy email address is not the buyer's personal email address, the buyer can <<step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email, respond to seller directly from your personal email account>> because EBA's proxy email forward all seller emails to the buyer's personal email and forward all messages sent from buyer's personal email to seller.

An added benefit of using EBA proxy email to manage buyer's email negotiation with seller is that each forwarded emails to or from sellers will be tagged with buyer's target vehicle link so the buyer can easily link any email with its original target vehcile link.



## Protect Your Privacy

For each of your target vehicle URL, you get a dedicated proxy email address through which you exchange email communications with dealer sales force, so that privacy of your personal email is protected.

## Step 2: Add Email Buyer Agent to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can start adding buyer agent to it

### Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/grab-vehicle-url.png[grab vehicle URL]

### Step 2.2: Create Email Buyer Agent

After target vehicle page is available, go back to the https://buytition.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget[buying project] you just created in <<step-1-create-a-buying-project, previous step>>, scroll to the bottom, click **Add Buyer Agent** link

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-bottom.png[buying project bottom]

Now a Email Buyer Agent proxy email (`bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case) is created, all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buyer-agent-created.png[Buyer Agent created notice]

### Step 2.3: Car Buying Worksheet

The created buyer agent will show up in the Buying Project page as shown below or can be accessed https://buytition.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#b42[here].  Buyer may add any number of such Buyer Agents and modify them to keep track all target vehicle and negotiation at one place so the buying project becomes buyer's buying worksheet.

## Step 3: How to use Proxy Email

After Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, a Proxy Email address is created.  The EBA proxy email is a powerful tool that enables easy three-way communication between project author, EBA author, and seller i.e. anybody else.

### Step 3.1: Peer-to-Peer Communication

Let's say I am helping Project Author on this buying project, and I created this EBA, very likely Project Author and I need to communicate with each other, for that purpose, I simply write an email to EBA proxy email address, in this demo `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, and send it, and EBA will forward that email to project author.  And vice versa, if project author does the same, I will receive that email from him/her.

The difference between this type of communication vs <<step-3-2-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller, seller communication>> is that for seller communication, you always need to reply an incoming email, but for peer-to-peer communication, you start from scratch and send it.

### Step 3.2: Collaboratively Communicate with Seller

A while after an EBA is created, EBA author will start receiving emails from seller,  which will be copied to project author as well if he/she was not EBA author.

In this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png[inbound email top]

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price.  If project author is a different person, he/she may reply to same email as well and I will be copied with that reply so I am notified that project author has replied.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG[reply dealer email, 365,649]


Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

## Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent


For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.


### Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login.png[email buyer agent after login]

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.

### Step 4.2 One Click Turn On / Off Agent

Turn on or off buyer agent with one click, one click to unsubscribe from all messages from sender without worrying about filling out complex form to unsubscribe

or turn on
