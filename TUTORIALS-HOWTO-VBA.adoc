After you submit the above simple form, the project is created like this or can be viewed https://buytition.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget[here]

# Step 2: Add Buyer Agent to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can start adding buyer agent to it

## Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

## Step 2.2: Create Buyer Agent

After target vehicle page is available, go back to the page of buying project you just created, scroll to the bottom, click **Add Buyer Agent** link

Then a Vehicle Buyer Agent proxy email (`bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case) is created, now all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

# Step 3: Communicate with Dealer via Proxy Email

In a while, you will receive email from dealer, in this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Vehicle Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Vehicle Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

# Step 4: Manage Buyer Agent


For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.


## Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.
