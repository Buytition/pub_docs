# What is Email Buyer Agent

Email Buyer Agent is a car buying tool developed by https://buytition.com[Buytition] for anybody who use email to negotiate car deals with dealers.  To use it, simply start a https://buytition.com/projects/show-form/start-project[Buying Project] for free, then start adding links of your dream cars to it so the project becomes your **Car Buying Worksheet**, and each added car link becomes **Email Buyer Agent** dedicated to track and manage all emails between you and dealer regarding that particular car, and you can mute/unmute each Email Buyer Agent with one-click and enjoy other powerful benefits listed below.

## Collaborative Negotiation

This is a powerful feature to allow multiple friends to help one person to negotiate best car deal with car dealers.  Once a Buying Project is created, project author can add Email Buyer Agents to it, at the same time, anybody else may also contribute to the project by adding target vehicle links to it as Email Buyer Agents (EBA).  If an EBA is added by a friend of project author, then EBA details and email messages can be accessed by not only EBA's author (project author's friend), but also project author.  All seller emails sent to EBA proxy email address will not only be forwarded to EBA's author but also buying project's author.

Once an Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, you can mute (or unsubscribe from) all emails sent to the EBA's proxy email address with one click, without need to fill out any unsubscribe form at all.  You may unmute all seller emails at any time later, also with one click.

## <<step-2-2-create-email-buyer-agent, Simple to Create>>

to create an Email Buyer Agent only requires your full name, email address and target vehicle link, price quote, and area information. We respect your privacy and only ask for information absolutely required to do our job, nothing more.

## <<step-3-communicate-with-dealer-via-proxy-email, Reply Directly from Personal Email>>

After an Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, even though agent's proxy email address is not your personal email address, you can respond to dealer directly from your personal email account because EBA proxy email forward all seller emails to your personal email and forward all messages sent from your personal email to seller.

An added benefit of using EBA proxy email to manage your email negotiation with seller is that each forwarded emails to or from sellers will be tagged with your target vehicle link so you can easily link any email with its original target vehcile link.

## <<step-41-check-buyer-agent-emails, Car Buying Worksheet>>

Once your buying project is created, you may add any number of links of target vehicles to it, for each of target vehicle link, you may also update target vehicle and price information and the buying project becomes car buying worksheet, at the same time, each added target vehicle link becomes dedicated Email Buyer Agent for that vehicle.

## Protect Your Privacy

For each of your target vehicle URL, you get a dedicated proxy email address through which you exchange email communications with dealer sales force, so that privacy of your personal email is protected.

# Step 3: Communicate with Dealer via Proxy Email

In a while, you will receive email from dealer, in this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png[inbound email top]

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG[reply dealer email, 365,649]


Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

# Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent


For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.


## Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.
