# What is Prediction FactCheck

Prediction FactCheck is a collection of publicly made predictions, fact checked and scored or waiting to be fact checked and scored.

Criteria of tracked predictions:

1. predictions with clear target time frame: clear future target time point of predicted event
2. predictions that are checkable: clear prediction that can be checked by facts
3. predictions that matter: predicted event must matter to audience

Here is [an example](https://finance.creaders.net/2022/06/22/2497071.html) of prediction that does not meet our criteria: 

> 威尔森（Michael Wilson）在内的摩根士丹利策略师21日表示，标普500指数要跌到2,900点至3,100点，才会更加完全反映在经济衰退期间典型的企业获利萎缩。大摩策略师群表示：“目前看来，根据联准会陷入的通膨处境，经济衰退不再只是个尾部风险。”

The reason for not meeting our criteria is because it is a conditional statement of future scenario, cannot be proved as true or false by facts; also it is missing a clear target time frame.

# Why Build Prediction FactCheck

We know how important it is to predict future as we all rely on predictions to make decisions in life: e.g. when to buy or sell houses, when and where to relocate.  We also know how hard it is to predict future accurately otherwise we will instantly become wealthy.

One way to make prediction is to gather as many predictions as possible on your interested topic and borrow intelligence from predictors and derive a collective view of future .  

# Our Approach Evaluating a Prediction

From perspectives of statistics and data, predictions of future events are in the forms of probability, this fact makes it hard to evaluate quality of a prediction since a historical event happens only once, you have no chance to calculate actual probability of an event and compare that with the predicted probability.

Instead, we use a simplified and a more straight-forward approach to evaluate prediction accuracy.  We view prediction as one non-random direction pointed out by predictors, after duration of prediction passes, we compare the factual direction against the original predicted direction, if they match, then we rate the prediction as `Hit`, otherwise, it's rated as `Miss`.
