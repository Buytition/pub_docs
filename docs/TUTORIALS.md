Group members are allowed to contribute [deals/price records](#what-is-price-record) (past price paid or price offers) on their target product/service. Here is the [buying group](https://savenowclub.com/groups/audi-q7) for Audi Q7 SUV.  

## How to Join a Buying Group

It's simple and easy to join an existing Buying Group or request to create a new one.

Either way, you need to fill out pretty much the same simple form,  all you need is to provide your email address (need to be verified) and name information as well as your target product name and zip code.  

After submission, you will be assigned to the appropriate buying group based on name of target product you provide, if no buying group exist for your target product yet, your membership still exists, it simply is the only member for your requested target product.

## Benefits of Buying Group

If you are organizing or about to join a Buying Group, consider the following advantage of SaveNowClub’s Buying Group vs. Google Form vs. WeChat Groups vs. Facebook Groups

**Deal Alerts**

Note: this feature is in development and will be available soon as of August 2021

* Group members are able to stay up to date with latest deals.  Once new deals are added, group members are immediately notified by email.

**Membership Management**

* Membership information of a Buying Group can be modified or deleted, while it’s not possible to do it on Google Form
* Group Members' email addresses will be verified while Google Sheet does not verify email addresses of sign up members
* Multiple types of members are allowed to join the group: Buyer, Dealer or Broker, this makes it easier to reach a deal
* Advantage over Facebook Groups: Members may remain anonymous to the public and to each other group members, while you have to show your real name in Facebook Groups

**Marketing Advantages**

* Buying Group page is public and easy to attract new members while keeping membership information private, but Google Form address is usually private and cannot generate organic traffic.
* Advantage over WeChat Groups: the fact that SaveNowClub buying group has a public page and allows dealers / brokers to join makes it easier to attract sellers to make offer to the group and to reach a deal, while WeChat Groups are private and lack a public page to attract sellers to make an offer.

# What is Price Record

For any [buying group](#what-is-buying-group), one or multiple price/deal data points may be added to it, these price/deal data points are called **Price Records**, these are what people look for when they research prices on their buying targets.  

## Types of Price Records

SaveNowClub supports two types of price records: price offer and price paid.

### Price Offer

These are currently active price quotes offered from sellers, for example, this offer on [2020 Ford Expedition MAX XLT](/projects/2441/price-offer-for-2020-ford-expedition-max-xlt#t326), it was posted on 2/1/2021, and it will stay valid until the listed product is sold or the price gets changed by seller.

Here is another [example price offer](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago#t86) of a price offer for a used SUV near Chicago area.

### Price Paid

These are past price paid records contributed by other buyers.  This is an [example price paid](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2413/buying-group-for-toyota-sienna-toyota-highlander-honda-odyssey-acura-mdx-nissan-armada#t310) for 2020 Toyota Highlander.  Since these records reflect transaction already happened, they generally do not expire.

## Components of Price Records

Each price record is made up of 3 parts: public information, private information and dedicated mailbox

* **public information**: accessible by general public, includes product/service name, price, area/zip code, and public description
* **private information**: accessible by owner and buyers of price record only, includes
    * available to both owner and buyers of price record: dealer information, deal making descriptions
    * available to only owner: source URL, vehicle VIN
* **dedicated mailbox**: optionally attached to a price record, accessible by owner of price record or group members of a buying group only. See [section](#dedicated-mailbox) below for more details

### Dedicated Mailbox

As you create a [Price Record](#what-is-price-record), you may choose to add a Dedicated Mailbox to it, the mailbox comes with these handy benefits

* an email address (e.g. `bot2111@buytition.com`) dedicated to this price record, your personal email sits behind this email address so your privacy is protected.
* all inbound/outbound email messages regarding a price record are organized in one place
* [collaborative communication to seller](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) and [peer-to-peer communication](#step-31-peer-to-peer-communication)
* [one-click mute incoming emails](#step-42-one-click-turn-on-off-agent)
* [reply directly](#step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email) from your personal email account
* each inbound/outbound message is tagged with price record link so you can easily trace it back to its original intent.

#### Collaborative Negotiation

You may collaborate on email negotiation with dealer to nail down the deal by checking `collboratively negotiate` box.

For a demo of this feature, see [collaborative communication to seller](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) and [peer-to-peer communication](#step-31-peer-to-peer-communication) in demo sections below.

# Beat Your Deal

After you purchase Buyer Broker Package, you will receive two parts: private information of the price record and Beat Your Deal service:

This part gives you a **real-life price point that beats your current best deal**.  However, the deal may be too far away from your location or may have hidden strings that do not guarantee the advertised price, these issues are addressed by another part of the package: Beat Your Deal service.

After this part completes, you will have a **realistic ready-to-close deal in your acceptable distance range that beats your current best deal**.

# Demo

Below you can find a simple tutorial of how to use Email Buyer Agent for your car buying.

## Step 1: Create a Buying Project

If you don't have an account yet, click [create an account](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) using a personal email address (in this tutorial I use `buytition.car@gmail.com`) and use it to [sign in](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/signin) to SaveNowClub.  If you have not verified your personal email yet, then click `Reset Password` button to verify it.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/sign-in-to-buytition.png" title="sign in to buytition" style="max-width:100%">

Open [Start Project](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) page to create a buying project for free and use it as a **car buying worksheet** to track all target vehicles and negotiations around them.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buying-project.png" title="create buying project" style="max-width:100%">

After you submit the above simple form, the project is created like this or can be viewed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget)

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-created.png" title="buying project created" style="max-width:100%">

## Step 2: Add Listing to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can add listing / price record to it in order to find a better deal to beat your listing or sell its information to other buyers who try to replicate your deal.

### Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/grab-vehicle-url.png" title="grab vehicle URL" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 2.2: Add Listing to Buying Project

After target vehicle page is available, go directly to [Add Listing section](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#action_add_update) of the project you just created in [previous step](#step-1-create-a-buying-project)

Fill out **Add Listing** form with vehicle name, vehicle URL and other vehicle details info found in [previous step](#step-21-find-your-target-vehicle-online), and click `Add Listing` button at bottom of form

You may sell information of your deal by checking `List information you enter in Keep These Private section below for sale` box and set a price yourself.  All price records on sale must satisfy  [listing criteria](#for-sellers-listing-criteria), otherwise listing will be removed from sale.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/list-price-record-for-sale.png" title="list price record for sale" style="max-width:100%">

You may also create a dedicated mailbox by checking `Create dedicated mailbox` box in the form.  After submitting the form, `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case was created, all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buyer-agent-created.png" title="Buyer Agent created notice" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 2.3: Car Buying Worksheet

The created buyer agent will show up in the Buying Project page as shown below or can be accessed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#b42).  Buyer may add any number of such Buyer Agents and modify them to keep track all target vehicle and negotiation at one place so the buying project becomes buyer's buying worksheet.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login-proxy-email.png" title="Buyer Agent proxy email tooltip" style="max-width:100%">

## Step 3: How to use Proxy Email

After Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, a Proxy Email address is created.  The EBA proxy email is a powerful tool that enables easy three-way communication between project author, EBA author, and seller i.e. anybody else.

### Step 3.1: Peer-to-Peer Communication

Let's say I am helping Project Author on this buying project, and I created this EBA, very likely Project Author and I need to communicate with each other, for that purpose, I simply write an email to EBA proxy email address, in this demo `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, and send it, and EBA will forward that email to project author.  And vice versa, if project author does the same, I will receive that email from him/her.

The difference between this type of communication vs [seller communication](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) is that for seller communication, you always need to reply an incoming email, but for peer-to-peer communication, you start from scratch and send it.

### Step 3.2: Collaboratively Communicate with Seller

A while after an EBA is created, EBA author will start receiving emails from seller,  which will be copied to project author as well if he/she was not EBA author.

In this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png" title="inbound email top" style="max-width:100%">

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price.  If project author is a different person, he/she may reply to same email as well and I will be copied with that reply so I am notified that project author has replied.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG" title="reply dealer email" style="max-width:369px;" <!--365,649-->>

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-03.png" title="inbound email" style="max-width:100%">

### Collaborative Group Negotiation Demo

Take for example the [dedicated mailbox](#dedicated-mailbox) `bot2270@buytition.com` that comes with [this price offer](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group#t245) for [Audi Q7 buying group](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group):

* all of its inbound or outbound email messages are visible (via [the link](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/messages?srch_term=BUYER_AGENT_ID:2270) next to the mailbox after login) to all participating buyers including price record owner, project owner and group members (if project is a buying group), in addition, participating buyers are allowed to reply to inbound emails on our website by clicking the bright orange icon on upper right corner of message detail page ([this](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/view_msg?id=70321) for example, member login required).
* its mailbox `bot2270@buytition.com` was created with the price record of 2021 Audi Q7 in MD, but it can also be used to negotiate deal with multiple dealers, simply use that address to start negotiation with any Audi dealers and email messages will be viewable and reply-able on this website by all group members.

## Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent

For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.

### Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login.png" title="email buyer agent after login" style="max-width:100%">

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/vehicle-email-list.png" title="Buyer Worksheet before edit" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 4.2 One Click Turn On / Off Agent

Turn on or off buyer agent with one click, one click to unsubscribe from all messages from sender without worrying about filling out complex form to unsubscribe

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-turned-off.png" title="buyer agent turned off" style="max-width:100%">

or turn on
